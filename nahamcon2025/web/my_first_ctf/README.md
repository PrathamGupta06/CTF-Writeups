# My First CTF
Author: BuildHackSecure @ HackingHub

HackingHub has provided this CTF challenge!

On second thoughts I should have probably called this challenge "Nz Gjstu DUG"


The website has an image rotten.jpg on the homepage only.
The challenge name and the challenge description hinted at a rot. Nz Gjstu DUG is rot1 rotation of My First CTF.

On enumerating several endpoints, rot1 rotation of flag.txt: gmbh.uyu gave the flag.
